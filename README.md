# Currency Converter

Made with React-native


# Instructions

As a user I want to send money between 2 countries to do so I will need to use the exercise app to see accurate conversion between origin and destination currencies, 
when entering the origin or destination currency the equivalent amount (by a certain conversion rate) should be presented. 
I expect to get a cheap and accurate rate (as much as possible).
